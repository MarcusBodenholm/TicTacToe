# Tic-Tac-Toe

This simple little project was primarily meant to train the use of IIFE. It features the complete gameplay loop of Tic-Tac-Toe, including accurate win condition checking. For fun, I added the ability to pick your own icon from a list of the traditional "X" and "O" as well as several different emojis.
